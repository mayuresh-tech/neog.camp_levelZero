        <p id="intro-content">Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many people I know.</p>

        <p id="intro-title">where can I see the final product?</p>
        <p id="intro-content">If you complete the entire course, you make something like this: <span id="intro-content highlight"><a href="../index.html" target="_blank">booklist app</a></span></p> 
        <p id="intro-content">However, the course doesn’t cover how to host it online. I have hosted the entire frontend and backend server for free. If you like to know how to host a React+GraphQL app, subscribe to the newsletter below and whenever I write it, you’ll get it straight into your inbox.</p>
